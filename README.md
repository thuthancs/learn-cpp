### some key concepts
- C++ does not run, but it compiles. Basically, it builds a machine program before it runs.
- In C++, types define behavior and memory layout. Types are checked at compile time, not at runtime (similar to TypeScript!!).
- Memory model: We can control when memory is created and destroyed.
